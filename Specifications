Avoid complex flow constructs, such as goto and recursion
All loops must have fixed bounds (this prevents runaway code)
Avoid heap memory allocation
Restrict functions to a single printed page
Use a minimum of two runtime assertions per function
Restrict the scope of data to the smallest possible
Check the return value of all nonvoid functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value is useless
Use the preprocessor sparingly
Limit pointer use to a single dereference, and do not use function pointers
Compile with all possible warnings active; all warnings should then be addressed before the release of the software
